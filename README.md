A Scala Command Line Menu System
================================

This is a Scala command line menu system framework. You define your menus, we'll show them to the user and handle their responses.

WARNING: This code doesn't work right now; I'm just checking it in so I can work from a few different computers.

To-Do
-----

* See TODO.txt

Notes
-----

Note: All the little ".gitignore" files are in the empty subdirectories so those directories would be checked into Git. (Git doesn't like empty directories, so you have to do something to get it to keep empty directories in the repo.)
